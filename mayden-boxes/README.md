I decided to challenge myself to learn new frameworks that I have hence REACT and MongoDB.  I also attempted in the time to ensure the HCI provided an effective user experience.

It took additional time setting up the IDE environment (Eclipse) and resolving NPM dependencies that I have not included as coding time.

#Starting
Install frontend and backend Node Modules - npm install (in both / and /backend)
At / - npm run start
At /backend - npm start express

Frontend port 3000, Backend port 5000

#ToDo
Fix DB Model to MongoDB - Had it working and tested in Insomnia but then I managed to break it - Will take some debugging at my end to check my model and the JSON object ;)
Update Table summary with Strength and Discount
Redirect/display Order Summary after Checkout

#Coding time
6 hours

#Summary
I took this as an opportunity for CPD and used frameworks that I do not use frequently at present.  The task was excellent in exposing many useful aspects of the React Framework, and how components and props behave.  I also took the opportunity to explore and compare a range of IDEs NetBeans, Atom, Eclipse before commencing the project.
